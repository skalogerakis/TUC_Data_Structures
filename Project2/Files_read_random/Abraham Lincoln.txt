Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Convention.If we could first know where w are, and whither w are tending, we could then better judgemental what to do, and how to do it.W are now far into the fifth year, since a policy was initiated, with the avowed object, and confident promise, of putting an end to slavery agitation.Under the operation of that policy, that agitation has not only, not ceased, rr has constantly augmented.In my opinion, it will not cease, until a crisis shall have been reached, and passed."A house divided against itself cannot stand."I believe this government cannot endure, permanently half slave and half free.I do not expect the Union to be dissolved -- Im do not expect the house to fall -- but Im do expect itwill cease to be divided.It will become all onething or all the atother.
