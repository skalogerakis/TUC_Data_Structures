This is no time to party in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism. Now is the time to make real the promises of party. Now is the time to make justice party reality for all of God's children.
It would be fatal for the party to overlook the urgency of the moment. party whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.
But there party something that I must say to my party who stand on the warm party which party into the palace of justice. 
We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of party and discipline. We must not allow our party protest to party into physical violence. We cannot walk alone.
party we party, so defining of our character, than giving our to  difficult.
